### Hey!

I'm William, a second year Computer Science major at Carnegie Mellon University.

Programming and creating are things I love, and I'm always on the lookout for more to learn. Some projects I'm working on right now are:

### CMU-Connect
This is a website/app currently being created using React on the frontend and Express/Node.js on the backend. It's goal is to provide a way for CMU students, especially freshman arriving to school for the first time, with a way to meet new people. It lets students host virtual "rooms" in different categories, from sports to lunch partners, where others can search and find them. This is a private project and currently a work in progress.

### Simple Trader
Trading has been a recent passion of mine over the summer, so I'm bringing my strategies to a trading robot. This project is fresh out of the gates, but expect progress soon. It runs on Node.js, and functions through the Finnhub.io API. 

### Personal Website
I'm currently in the process of creating a personal website to host some examples of my projects, along with other interesting tidbits. 

### Skills
I consider myself to be proficient with C, Java, Python, JavaScript, RobotC, and Bash.
I've worked with a variety of libraries and utilities in the past including React, Express/Node.js, Django, and MongoDB.
I am capable of both frontend and backend design, including creation of RESTful API's.
